#Factorial

##Write a script called factorial.py that takes a number and returns its factorial. Use pytest in a separate file called test_factorial.py ##to test your function.

Steps:
Think about which tests you want to do to test that the factorial function works.
Write the tests first (before creating the function).
Test an empty function called factorial - it should fail the tests
Add code for returning the factorial of a number - it should pass for numbers >= 1
Add code for dealing with zero - should pass unit test for zero and for numbers >= 1
Add code for dealing with negative numbers
Add code for dealing with non-numeric input
Once you are done, upload your tests and function to Github.
